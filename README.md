## Introduction

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is an open-source server-side scripting language that is especially suited for web development. It can be embedded into HTML and is known for its ability to create dynamic web pages.

This repository contains various code examples, exercises, and projects that I am working on as I learn PHP.

## Getting Started

To get started with PHP, you'll need to set up a local development environment. Here are some steps to help you get started:

1. **Install PHP**: Download and install PHP from [php.net](https://www.php.net/downloads).
2. **Set Up a Local Server**: You can use XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP to create a local server environment.
3. **Clone this Repository**: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
